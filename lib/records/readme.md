> In software engineering, the data mapper pattern is an architectural pattern.
It was named by Martin Fowler in his 2003 book Patterns of Enterprise
Application Architecture.[1] The interface of an object conforming to this
pattern would include functions such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete, that
operate on objects that represent domain entity types in a data store.

> A Data Mapper is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional transfer of
data between a persistent data store (often a relational database) and an
in-memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern is to
keep the in-memory representation and the persistent data store independent of
each other and the data mapper itself. The layer is composed of one or more
mappers (or Data Access Objects), performing the data transfer. Mapper
implementations vary in scope. Generic mappers will handle many different
domain entity types, dedicated mappers will handle one or a few.
